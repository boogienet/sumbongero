# Sumbongero

Sumbongero is a tagalog word for tattle-tale.

Sumbongero is an email reporting library. It takes your
email information, and reports on the count within folders.

It considers 3 folders as its "base":

- Inbox
- Sent
- Deleted

You can tell it to report on other folders.

The plan is to use this for metrics for GTD and Inbox-Zero.
